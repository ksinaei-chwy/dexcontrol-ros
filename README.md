## 📦 Installation

```shell
pip install dexcontrol
```

To run the examples in this repo, you can try:

```shell
pip install dexcontrol[example]
```

## ⚠️ Version Compatibility

**Important:** `dexcontrol >= 0.4.0` requires robot firmware `>= 0.4.0`. Using older firmware with this version will not work.

> **Note:** `dexcontrol 0.4.x` depends on `dexcomm >= 0.4.0`, which is **not compatible** with `dexcontrol 0.3.x`. If you need to stay on `dexcontrol 0.3.x`, do not upgrade `dexcomm` to `0.4.0` or above.

**Before upgrading, check your current firmware version:**
```shell
dextop firmware info
```

If your firmware is outdated, please update it before installing the new version to ensure full compatibility. Please contact the Dexmate team if you do not know how to do it.

**📋 See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes and version history.**
